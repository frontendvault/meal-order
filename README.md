# MPO Project

This project is a web application developed for MPO (Meal Planning Online), a platform that offers meal planning and delivery services. The application is built using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mpo-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mpo-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the pages by modifying the files in the `pages` directory. The changes will be automatically reflected in the browser as you edit the files.

## API Routes
